# DriverAwarenessApp

## Overview

DriverAwarenessApp is a React Native mobile application built using Expo, designed to detect the sleepiness of drivers and alert them using color changes and SMS notifications. The app utilizes a custom API to retrieve information from a database, which is sourced from a Raspberry Pi 4 module equipped with a camera for real-time driver monitoring.

**Hackathon Project:** This app originated from a hackathon at our local university, where the goal was to address road safety concerns by leveraging technology.

## Features

- Real-time sleepiness detection using AI-powered camera input.
- Color changes in the app interface to alert the driver.
- SMS notifications for immediate attention.
- Integration with a Raspberry Pi 4 module for driver state information.
- We used custom AI models to detect the sleepnes.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed before proceeding.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/DriverAlert.git
    cd DriverAwarenessApp
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To run the app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Expo CLI installed globally:

    ```bash
    npm install -g expo-cli
    ```

2. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

3. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device or run the app on an emulator.
